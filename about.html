                <h2>Traits</h2>

                <p>My strongest traits, such as theorizing and making connections between scenarios, have a profound impact on my academic life. These abilities enable me to approach my studies with a unique perspective. When theorizing, I delve deeply into subjects, uncovering hidden layers and understanding complex concepts. This analytical prowess allows me to excel in problem-solving and critical thinking. Moreover, my talent for making connections between scenarios helps me draw parallels across different subjects, fostering interdisciplinary insights. In my academic pursuits, these traits allow me to see the bigger picture and identify patterns that might elude others. Furthermore, my hobbies like drawing and design complement my academic journey. They provide a creative outlet for my innovative thinking and help me visually express the ideas and theories I conceptualize, enhancing my ability to communicate and share my insights with others. This combination of traits and hobbies makes me a unique and effective learner, with a distinct approach to my studies.</p>

                <p>I'm into a few different things like drawing, 3D modeling, photography, making short videos, and playing video games (GTA mostly) and basketball. In my down time I like to do things that aren't as intellectually challenging as what I do at school or work, to relax and destress a bit.</p>

                <h4>Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender</h4>
                <p>
                    Aang, the protagonist of "Avatar: The Last Airbender," is a young Airbender with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He grapples with the dichotomy of an unfulfilled childhood and the expectation that he must take care of the world and all its problems. Aang's unwavering commitment to peace, his humility, and his ability to bridge cultures make him a truly remarkable character because instead of killing Firelord Ozai (as he was being told to do) he took away his bending instead. That, to me, was the perfect resolution to the main conflict of the show, Aang proved he didn't have to fight fire with fire (pun intended) to win the war, Ozai was left to sit with the fact that despite all his efforts and inhumanity he would never be the most powerful of all benders and Aang reached max spiritual awareness as the Avatar, making him the strongest to have ever lived.

                <h4>Miles Morales from The Spiderverse Trilogy</h4>
                <p>
                    Miles Morales, the central figure in "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," embodies an exceptional hero.  It's a mature narrative that underscores the timeless theme of personal growth in the face of extraordinary challenges, and throughout all this Miles never loses his witty personality embedded in all the spidersonas. He acknowledged and feared the extremely big shoes he he had to fill after Peter was murdered but despite that - and the fact that he had no idea what he was doing or where to even start - he embraced the responsibility that came with the powers he was given. He did what he had to and grew to love it. My favourite part of the storyline is that Miles disregards "the canon", and refuses to believe he was never meant to be Spider-Man - that the universe would put on his shoulders a burden he wasn't fit to carry.

                    I usually don't place all my bets on personality tests and indicators because there is no set of questions that can extract the contents of my mind and soul to tell me who I am. I did this test twice before I got the results I felt truly reflect my personality changes over the past 5 years. The first result was INFJ-Assertive and the second being INFJ-Turbulent - the second works better for me since I have a more anxious personality rather than a confident, relaxed one and I get stressed easily.
